### Full Stack Web Developer

- I'm looking for an opportunity to start my career in the development area, I don't care about the salary but about the experience I can acquire.
- I'm currently studying database with PostgreSQL.
- I'm currently working on projects developed in the full stack web development course at **Growdev**.</br></br>
The Full Stack Web Developers Training Program has 1000 hours, with approximately 11 months of live classes and synchronous and asynchronous content, expected to end in January 2022.</br>
Within the syllabus is:</br>
Introduction to systems development,</br>
Relational and non-relational database,</br>
**Front-end + Back-end** programming,</br>
Architecture,</br>
Software Engineering and Quality.</br>
With technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PWA, PaaS, Postgres and more.
In addition to the applied project, a real experience in building a software project with Growdev's engineering team.</br>

After completing this training at the end of this year, I will start training in Systems Analysis and Development at Feevale to further improve my knowledge, as I understand that "improvement" is a constant need in this area, in fact it is one of the things I like most , because I like to constantly challenge myself with something new to keep evolving.</br>
So if you identified yourself, liked my profile or even would like to give me some tips, show!!!, I'm open to suggestions, so please share your opinion so I can keep evolving.</br>
